## 🙋‍♀️ What is this organization all about?

**Persona Management Layer (PML)** is an open standards organization under **IbIFACE**  
focused on bringing **structure, governance, and trust** to AI systems.

We design **open specifications, protocols, and reference implementations** that make
**personas, roles, and delegation** first-class architectural concepts in AI.

Our projects (ARAL, PML, PCL, ADP) aim to ensure that AI systems:

- know _who they are_,
- understand _why they act_,
- and remain _auditable, governable, and accountable_.

This organization builds foundations — not hype.

## 🌈 How can you contribute?

We welcome thoughtful contributions from the community:

- 💬 **Discussions & design reviews** (architecture, specs, governance)
- 🧪 **Feedback on drafts** (standards are living documents)
- 🧠 **Research insights** (AI safety, governance, systems design)
- 🛠 **Reference implementations & examples**
- 🧾 **Issues, critiques, and proposals**

We value:

> clarity over noise · quality over speed · standards over shortcuts

Please read each repository’s `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `GOVERNANCE.md` before contributing.

## 🍿 Fun facts

- ☕ Breakfast of choice: **coffee, espresso, or strong tea**
- 🥐 Side dish: **ideas, diagrams, and invariants**
- 🧠 Most discussions start with:  
  _“Wait… what is the invariant here?”_

Yes — we take breakfast seriously.  
And architecture even more.
