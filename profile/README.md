## 🙋‍♀️ What is this organization all about?

**Persona Management Layer (PML)** is an open standards organization under **IbIFACE**  
focused on bringing **structure, governance, and trust** to AI systems.

We design **open specifications, protocols, and reference implementations** that make
**personas, roles, and delegation** first-class architectural concepts in AI.

Our projects (ARAL, PML, PCL, ADP) aim to ensure that AI systems:

- know _who they are_,
- understand _why they act_,
- and remain _auditable, governable, and accountable_.

This organization builds foundations — not hype.
