# Persona Management Layer (PML)
## The Open Standard for Persona-Driven AI Systems

Design · Governance · Execution · Trust

> Build AI systems that know *who they are*, *why they act*, and *how to stay accountable*.

## Why this organization exists

Modern AI systems are powerful — but unstructured.

They lack stable identities, explicit roles, governance boundaries, portable behavior definitions, and shared standards across tools and platforms.

The Persona Management Layer organization exists to solve this problem.

We design open standards, protocols, and reference implementations that make personas a first-class primitive in AI systems.

## Core Vision

Personas are not UI features.  
They are architectural control units.

A persona defines intent, scope, behavioral constraints, output contracts, and governance rules.
